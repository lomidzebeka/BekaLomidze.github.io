- Experimental study on the social preferences of the general public for compensation in different contexts.
- We randomize the cause of the cost inequality to see the shift in preferences in different contexts.
- This allows us to see to what extent respondents choose to compensate and therefore with which normative principles they align.
- But also where they put the cutpoint between legitimate and illegitimate inequality as developed in the EOp literature.
