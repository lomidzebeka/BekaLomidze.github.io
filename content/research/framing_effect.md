Using a randomized survey experiment sent out to 4508 respondents, we distributed eight statements related to health inequalities, where respondents could answer on a 10-point Likert scale to what extent they believed those statements to be unfair. We created two type of framing for these statements: First, a neutral framing that states the situation as is and another type that puts an emphasis on individual responsability. These two framing were randomly assigned to our respondents.

We can then observe not only the impact of the framing on respondents aversion to inequality but also estimate which characteristics explains the size of the shift in health inequality aversion due to the change in framing.
