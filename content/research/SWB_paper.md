Using a once in a decade storm that affected Sweden we estimate the impact on insurance take-up
and subjective well-being using a tailor-made survey data(N=769) combined with remote-sensed data on
damages brought by the storm. We also explore how it affected perception about the future and related
behavioral mechanisms influencing theses changes.
